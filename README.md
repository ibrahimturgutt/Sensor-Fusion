# Sensor-Fusion
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive assignment on sensor fusion, focusing on the design and performance analysis of various filters for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. The study covers Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Particle Filter (PF), and Adaptive H-Infinity Filter (AHINF), employing MATLAB for simulations and evaluations under different jammer conditions.
