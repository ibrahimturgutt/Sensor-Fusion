%   The algorithm goes through: prompts & constants, simulation parameters,
%   variable initialisation, main loop, error checking and plotting

%   There are two distinct parts: the flyby section and the orbital
%   adaptation main loop uses simple Euler integration to update the UAV
%   dynamics and it updates filter parameters

%   Matrices (or vectors) are in column form that is each new entry forms a
%   new line i.e: A(k+1,:)=...
%   WARNING: THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS are filters' states which are in line form
%   i.e: A(:,k+)=...

%   The floor function is used to get a integer out of a percentage of
%   another integer e.g floor((5/100)*N_loops_fb): integer of 5/100 of total
%   number of iterations of the simulation

%   The rem (remainder) function is used to know if a number divided by
%   another is an integer (Euclidian division)
